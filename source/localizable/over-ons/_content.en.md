## Craft Beer Store in Groningen
Just in Beer opened in March 2017 with the idea there was a need for a truly specialist beer store in Groningen. That is why we specialize in all kinds of specialty beer for enthusiasts. There's already plenty of liquor stores with a wide range of beverages, but moderate beer supply. Time for a change!

### For beer lovers, by beer lovers
We want to serve the enthusiasts out of enthousiasm for beer. At Just in Beer you'll therefore only find the best local, national and international beer. We also love all beer styles (and there are quite a few). That's reflected in our wide range of beer styles.

### Service
Good service comes first for us. Do you have questions about beer, are you looking for something special? Our expert staff will gladly help you further.

We always try to improve ourselves in terms of service, assortment and the availability of beers. Our standard range has therefore grown and we are selling great specials more and more. We have also recently became an Untappd Verified Venue, which enables us to keep our public well informed about the ever-changing beer list.

### More than beer
Besides providing great beer, we try to make a substantial contribution to the beer community. That is why we organized the Hop! into the Grain Craft Beer & Music Festival at EM2 The Barn in Groningen, where we combined the best of both worlds.

And earlier, we organized a concert of Meadowlake in the store, with a tasting of one of Groningen's young breweries: Brouwerij Eggens.
