### Cold Beer
We sell fresh IPA's and other chilled beers directly from our refrigerator. Ideal if you're looking for a cold beer-on-the-go.

### Beer in Can (yes we CAN!)
Beer in cans is becoming increasingly popular. And we are huge fans of canned beer, too. Not only does it offer logistic advantages (you can build great walls with it...), the beer is also better protected against external influences. Perfect for beer that needs to be poured as fresh as possible, such as IPAs. That's why we always have fresh beer in stock.

### Perfect Beer Gifts
We sell various gift packages. In addition, it is possible to compose a nicely packaged personalized package with, for example, regional beers, or beer of a certain style. We also sell Just in Beer gift cards, with value of your choice.
