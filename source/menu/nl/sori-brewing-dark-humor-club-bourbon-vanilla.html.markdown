description: "Sweet, dessert-like Imperial Stout with loads of flavor. Cacao nibs and espresso make this a liquid mocha cake. We added over a hundred Bourbon vanilla pods to make it a delicious treat.  Dark Humor Club is fun, super dark and with every sip it reveals something new. Enjoy as a dessert and pair with chocolate."
