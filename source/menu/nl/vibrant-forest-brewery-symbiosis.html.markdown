description: "Symbiosis â€“ the cooperation between two organisms for mutual benefit.  In this example, Vibrant Forest and Unity Brew Co getting giddy over sugars and spice and everything noice.  We blended aromatic malts to create a complex grist and  fermented it on an Unity's Abbey yeast.  Orange peel, raisins, and nutmeg went into the boil to enrich this broth with all the flavours of the season.    Released 21/11/18 with Belgium and Blues in Southampton.   Part of the 2018 Vibrant Forest Dark Beer Box "
