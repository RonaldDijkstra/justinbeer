description: "A super juicy IPA,  hopped with a generous  helping of Galaxy hops.  Lychee, passionfruit,  and peach aroma follow  through to the palette  where citrus and melon  notes join in to make  a thoroughly enjoyable  beer. All this delivered  with a silky mouth feel  from the wheat and barley  grain base"
