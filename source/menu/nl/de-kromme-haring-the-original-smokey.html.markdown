description: "He's back! We made multiple renditions of Smokey the Barracuda, as we brewed it at different breweries over the years. All the while, Smokey changed quite a bit as our favourite gangster got some schooling and scars. Now that we finally can brew it on the system of our brewpub, we decided to go back to the first recipe, enhanced by our experiences along the way. The Original Smokey is big and intense, at first a bit intimidating, but surprisingly smooth at the end. "
