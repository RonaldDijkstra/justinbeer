description: "Juicy, soft, and full of ripe tropical fruit flavours from a blend of hops and aromatic yeast, this IPA is our modern take on a classic style. Showcasing hop flavours and yeast esters against a big body from high protein malts, to replicate the mouthfeel of tropical fruit, this beer finishes with a low bitterness to let the hop aromas and flavours linger on your palate.  Aroma & Palate: Mango pulp and pineapple chunks, combined with navel orange  Body: Silky, full bodied and juicy with soft carbonation  Aftertaste: Lasting juicy orange and noticeable peppery character"
