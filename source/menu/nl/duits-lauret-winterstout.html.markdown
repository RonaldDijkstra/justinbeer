description: "This heavy winter warmer combines all the beauty of the Duits & Lauret Stout with a powerful taste and a warming aftertaste. Due to its fullness and balance the beer combines well with wintery stews and distinct blue-veined cheeses. Duits & Lauret Winterstout is a top fermenting beer, unfiltered and unpasteurized with secondary fermentation on bottle and cask. Serve lightly cooled at a temperature between 12 and 14 degrees centigrade. Itâ€™s a beer with an alcohol percentage of 8.5 and is available from November until February."
