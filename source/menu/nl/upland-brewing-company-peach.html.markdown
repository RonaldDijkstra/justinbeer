description: "Aged on our mildly tart base blonde sour ale, Peach is a fruited sour ale made with whole peaches locally sourced from Huber's Orchard and Winery. Gold and straw colors shine upon pouring, with zesty amounts of carbonation. Fresh peach aromas meld with floral and wine-like notes. Wonderful peach flavors follow in the taste, accompanied by refreshing tartness. The finish is dry with mouthwatering tanginess and peach flavor."
