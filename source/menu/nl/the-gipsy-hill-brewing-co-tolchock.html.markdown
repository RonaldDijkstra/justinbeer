description: "Using our new favourite Kveik yeast strain, we ramped this beer up to a plus 30dC fermentation to kick out serious orange flesh esters before loading it up on Centennial, Motueka and Mandarina Bavaria hops.  It’s a clean, beautiful, textured beer with orange rind, tangerine and lemon zest notes.  Goes well with Beethoven and Nadsat.  Featuring Marcus, Gipsy Hill’s Creative Director and label maestro."
