description: "Like its paragon, the man eating giant, Polyphemos is a huge, bold and keeps you tangled. This Imperial Stout is brewed together with Seven Island Brewery from Corfu, Greece. Inspired by the Greek Portokalopita dessert, we brewed this beer using seven different malts, tangerine, cinnamon and milk sugar. A thick dessert to be enjoyed slowly."
