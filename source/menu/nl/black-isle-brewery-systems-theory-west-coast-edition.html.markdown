description: "Black Isle and Poppels from Sweden collaborated a year or so ago to make a fantastic imperial stout called Systems Theory. Since then the beer has been maturing in whisky barrels and is now ready to make a reappearance. There are two versions - a West coast version (using Islay barrels which gives a peaty flavour) and an East coast version which has oak, vanilla and dark chocolate notes."
