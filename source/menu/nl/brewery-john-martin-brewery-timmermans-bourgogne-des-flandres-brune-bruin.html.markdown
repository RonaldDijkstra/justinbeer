description: "Commercial description by brewer :  Bourgogne des Flandres is the real taste of Bruges. The mixed fermentation is what makes this beer so special. The top-fermented brown ale is subtly blended with the best spontaneously fermented lambic, which is then matured in oak barrels for many months. It is this process that gives the red-brown beer a rich, creamy finish.  About the style: Even though  Bruin  suggests a style like  Old Brown  or  Brown Ale , this beer should definitively be classified as Flanders Red Ale (Category 23B in BJCP 2015), because its aromas and flavors are rather fruity than malty, it has mixed fermentation, it's aged in oak casks and its brewing location is in West Flanders."
