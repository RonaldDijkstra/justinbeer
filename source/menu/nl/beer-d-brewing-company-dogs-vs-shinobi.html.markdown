description: "We joined forces with our Chicago brethren from Pipeworks Brewing Company for this mashup of two of our favorite brands.  Dogs Vs. Shinobi takes each breweries lead brand and mashes them together into a hazy, fruit forward, lower ABV offering.  Citra, Simcoe and Mosaic hops and Guava Puree lend notes of fresh orange peel and other tropical characters.  This will certainly be a battle for the ages! "
