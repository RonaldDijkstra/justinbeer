description: "Gajes - Awarded 'Best beer of the Netherlands 2016' in the Dutch Beer Challenge.  Gajes (Dutch slang for scum) is a heavily dry hopped tripel.   We used a very neutral top fermenting yeast strain that produces a clean balanced beer with a smooth malty sweetness.   Three additions of bright floral hops build to a crisp-citrus-bitter crescendo (a gradual, steady increase in force).   A liquid poem to the glory of the hop , utterly deserving of its name and a craft beer you won't soon forget."
