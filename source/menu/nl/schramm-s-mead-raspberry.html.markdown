description: "Schrammâ€™s Raspberry is a raspberry mead made from whole Michigan raspberries and Orange Blossom honey purchased directly from Fruitwood Orchards, a New Jersey apiary that pollinates citrus in Florida. It is drinkable on purchase, but as a result of the high level of acidity in the berries, it can age gracefully for several years. It pairs well with grilled salmon, salads, and cheesecake."
