description: "Our interpretation of an IPA in the popular east-coast style. Bad Mango is brewed with a shitload of Mosaic hops, followed post-fermentation by a shitload of Mango puree to give it a tropical boost. A juicy beer, with a moderate bitterness and an extremely high fruitiness. Our tribute to the east coast!"
