description: "Heineken is a 5% ABV euro pale lager, made by Heineken International since 1873. It is available in a 4.3% alcohol by volume, in countries such as Ireland. It is the flagship product of the company and is made of purified water, malted barley, hops, and yeast. In 1886 H. Elion finished the development of the Heineken A-yeast. This is the yeast that is still used for the beer. The beer is force carbonated. It is popular in the United States, Europe and Middle Eastern countries."
