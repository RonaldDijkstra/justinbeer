description: "Brewed with liquorice root and vanilla. Robust with sweetness and depth.   ----  You say ‘porter’. we say ‘poorter’.  Some say the beer known as ‘porter’ is of dutch origin. ‘Poorter’ was long favoured by hard-working labourers for its hearty and refreshing taste. Our poorter celebrates the haul of exotic botanicals, by poorters from the dockside into Amsterdam warehouses. Climb aboard! "
