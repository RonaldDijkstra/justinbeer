description: "Welcome to a post Punk apocalyptic mother fucker of a pale ale.  A beer that spent its formative years Blitzkrieg bopping around India and the sub continent. Quintessential Empire with an anarchic twist.  God save the Queen and all who sail in her. Raising a Stiff Little Finger to IPAs that have come before and those it is yet to meet.  Turn up the volume Pay the man. Embrace the punked up, fucked up outlaw elite.  Never Mind the Bollocks this is the real shit.  Malts: Marris Otter Extra Pale.  Hops: Chinook, Simcoe, Ahtanum, Nelson Sauvin."
