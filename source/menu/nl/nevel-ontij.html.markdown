description: "Ontij - Barrel-aged wild ale with shadows.  Ontij is our International Women's Collaboration Brew Day blend made by the women of Nevel. It's a sour beer with dark shadows, made to honour the wild side of womanhood. No sweet flavours, no frivolous gimmicks, but an embrace of our darker self, our inner witch, the ferocious force that takes after she has given. Femininity in freedom. No tongues to bind you, no arms to withhold. We hope to offer you a glimpse of our magic with Ontij, an untamed beer that feels no desire to please. Ontij contains foraged myrica gale, sumac, annual mugwort and rose petals. There are only 250 bottles available of this very limited release. 5.5% ABV  [Batch #1: bottled on 10 APR 2019]"
