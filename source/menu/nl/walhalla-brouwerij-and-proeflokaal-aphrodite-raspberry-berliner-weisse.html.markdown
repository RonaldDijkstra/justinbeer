description: "APHRODITE is the Greek goddess of love, embodied by the deep pink hue of the grotesque amount of raspberries we added to this nimble kettle soured Berliner Weisse. We think youâ€™ll fall head over heels in love with the massive fruit character and eminent drinkability of this seductive little beer that only clocks in at 4%."
