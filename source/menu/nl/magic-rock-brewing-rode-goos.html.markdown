description: "Our old pal Kees from Brouwerij Kees stopped by for this fruited version of that classic German Wheat beer style Gose. Using our tried and tested Salty Kiss method we fermented with German ale yeast and went big on the fruit with Pomegranate, Cherry and Lemon additions to deliver a deeply fruity and deeply pink beer with a light acidic tang and balanced tart finish.  Malts: Golden Promise, Acidulated Malt, Wheat Malt, Vienna Malt Hops: T90 East Kent Golding Yeast: WLP029"
