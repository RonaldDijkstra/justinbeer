description: "In this New-American Hoppy Ale the undeniable flavors and olfactory sensations of tropical citrus, peach-nectar and sweet lime burst and explode from the combination of Motueka, Centennial, and Simcoe hops.  Obscure as we are, a glass candle has shown us the way. This is the sound of inspiration."
