description: "Going round and round and up and down we go, again and again. On a horse, in a carriage, or why not on a bunny or a cow with a bowtie? Bring your friends, laugh and scream, eat ice-cream, dream. Life is a party every day when you are riding the creamy carousel, like a childhood memory, or a Berliner Weisse full of lime, raspberry, lemongrass and malva flowers"
