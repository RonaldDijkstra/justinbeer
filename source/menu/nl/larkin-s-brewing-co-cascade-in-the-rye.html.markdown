description: "Double IPA brewed with malted and caramel rye to give a sweet, spicy malt base. Vermont yeast gives a big chewy body with peach, apricot and perfumed notes. Centennial and Citra in the whirlpool, followed by a double dry hop of Cascade, Mosaic and Citra, gives a complex bouquet of stone fruits, grapefruit, rosewater and berries."
