description: "Illusion is our latest creation, which is inspired by the awesome new beer style created in the States known as Imperial Black Ale. We really admire the profile of this new style but wanted a session strength version. We brewed ours at 4.5% instead of the typical 8%+, but wanted to retain the unique flavour profile. We sourced the special malt required from Germany and the hops from America to create a beer of stunning depth and complexity. The beer is black in appearance but lacks the acrid flavours associated with all other dark beers. This is achieved through use of the special German malt. The hop aromas and flavours are very intense, which we achieve through a major dose of dry-hopping in the cask. The result is a beer that wraps all the wonderful hop profiles of a pale ale inside a silky black exterior. It is truly an Illusion that deceives your eyes and dazzles your taste buds. Due to the rare nature of these special ingredients it is a limited release beer, but we are looking at making it more regularly available if possible."
