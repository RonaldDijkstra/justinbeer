description: "We've named this limited edition beer 23 trees as a dedication to replace 23 ancient trees that were needlessly felled on the bordering land to our Organic farm on the black isle. We love our surroundings, welcome the birds and the bees and work hard to maintain our land so that wildlife can thrive naturally. We will not stand for the irresponsible destruction of 23 perfectly good broad-leaf trees which provided a habitat for hundreds of species, oxygen we breathe and beautiful century-old character to our environment. We will replace these 23 trees and will plant 200 more in their place.   Aroma - Citrus and tropical fruit, spice faint pine resin, candied peel.   Appearance - Pale straw colour, rocky/frothy bright white head, sparkly high carbonation.   Flavour - Spice, tropical fruit, slightly sweet, rich malt body, light peppery heat, zest."
