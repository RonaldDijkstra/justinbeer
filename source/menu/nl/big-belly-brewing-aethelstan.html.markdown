description: "Æthelstan is a thick and well balanced Imperial Porter. We used peated whisky malts to give a little touch of whisky flavor. Togheter with the very extensive malt bill, Æthelstan has a complex flavor not a lot of other beers offer. Don't drink it too cold and enjoy is slowly. Cheers! "
