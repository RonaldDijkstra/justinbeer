description: "Beluga is a bold, roasted Russian Imperial Stout. Complex and luxurious, we get the requisite chocolate and coffee flavours, but enriched with subtle hints of leather and dried fruits. Take your time to savour this beer, as it needs rumination, and just might provoke deeper contemplation."
