description: "Working with our Leeds neighbours North Brew Co, we put together this 'pinkest' of the fruit sours. Showcasing the fleshy cactus fruit prickly pear, we then backed it up with the zingy tropical notes of guava, a touch of tangy raspberry and rounded everything out with milk sugar and salt."
