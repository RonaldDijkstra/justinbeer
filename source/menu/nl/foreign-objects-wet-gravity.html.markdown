description: "The density of our beloved hop essence in this gorgeous silken beer drips down from your head and soaks your feet. We hopped this densely with the eternally saturating Citra and Azacca hops. The aromas of passion fruit, mango, and deep citrus-resin will drag you down by the river's edge like rocks in your pockets, showing through like the deep brainsqueals and infinite pulse of gravity clinging to your senses and calling you home from across the furthest extremes of creation's immensity."
