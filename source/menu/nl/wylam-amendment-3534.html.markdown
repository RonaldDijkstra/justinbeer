description: "18.0Â° Plato | OG 1074.0 | ABV 7.1%  Fruit IPA... Using our classic IPA formula as a foundation with a late house yeast generation bringing out all the ripe stone fruit esters we added fresh pineapple, papaya and passion fruit alongside IDAHO 7 and BRU 1 to this IPA. Naturally soured using the fruit with all the freshness we could squeeze out to boot!"
