description: " Garún is named for the strong and brave heroine of one of Iceland’s most popular folktales  The deacon of Dark River.  A tale of ghosts, undying love, and life triumphing over death told against the backdrop of elements essential to Iceland’s character: ice, snow, and flooding waters whirling dark and mysterious. The same elements that inspire this rich, intense, bold and swirlingly varied Icelandic stout. Garún is a dark aura of intense richness and haunting aroma with notes of chocolate, licorice and coffee."
