description: "For this enchanted Schwarzwalder Kirsch stout we made like Repunzel and let down our hair in Germanyâ€™s enchanted Black Forest. You know, the grim fairy-tale settings for Grimm Brother self-flagellation and fun? Well, those Black Forest fairies also know how to distill a mean sharp-nosed cherry liquor known as Schwarzwalder Kirsch. Dark and murky with a touch of vanilla and raison around the edges, this distinctive chilly weather sweet stout is best sipped in castles amongst cuckoo clocks. A tart, puckery fairy-tale capable of knocking the dirndl off of Sleeping Beauty, that girl Gretel and every wicked Grimm Gros- mutter every put to paper."
