description: "ABV DRAUGHT 3.8%, BOTTLED 4%. A very hoppy and refreshing bitter, brewed to celebrate the revival of the brewery, and meant to revive you when you need it. Light in colour but not flavour thanks to a blend of Pale, Lager, Cara, Crystal and Wheat malts. The hops are a blend of American varieties, with American-style yeast providing a crisp finish.  For a beer relatively low in alcohol it has a very full flavour and drinks well above its strength, earning it a multitude of awards and setting the standard for the style.  A modern classic!"
