description: "Ajax is the Great is Greek, mythological hero known for courage (and some craziness) - as are these two modern era brewers. Brothers in craft from Estonia and Greece brewed a crazy courageous New England DIPA. Refreshing and full of fruits like a spring in Corfu. Infused with real mango with experimental HPA-035 and Mosaic hops."
