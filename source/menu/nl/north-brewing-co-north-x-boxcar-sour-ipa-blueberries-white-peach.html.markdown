description: "Sam from Boxcar headed up to Leeds in March for a double brew day here at North. We brewed two beers using the same malt profile: One was soured and had two tonnes (!) of blueberries and white peach added to it. One was dry hopped in the same style that we brew our IPAs. We then blended the two beers together to come up with this lip puckering Sour IPA. It's fruity, jammy, with a hoppy finish (and the colour's not bad too...)."
