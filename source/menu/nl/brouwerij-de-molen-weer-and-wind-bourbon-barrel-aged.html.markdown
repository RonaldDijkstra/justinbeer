description: "Pours deep brown garnet with a dark tan head which slowly disappears. Aroma is quite decadent with booze, vanilla, oak, buttercream, toffee & ofcourse bourbon. In taste the sweetness overpowers any bitterness that may try and get a look in. It's hard to guess the ABV. A dangerous but delicious lady!  (Ratebeer.com: 99 overall & 98 style) Translates as Wind & Weather"
