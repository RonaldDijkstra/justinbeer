description: "Weide - Wild light ale with local Spalter Select.  A picnic in the grass on a lazy afternoon, the sun high in the sky, your bare feet playing with the tiny blades. The soft buzzing of a honey bee visiting nearby flowers carries you away, a bird chirps excitedly in the woods. A small insect tickles your skin, a broken sprig pricks your side. A lost dewdrop clings stubbornly to the grass, the wind carries the sweet scent of hay from a neighbouring farm.     Weide is best enjoyed on a warm day when a dry, refreshing beer is the best way to cool down. It is a particularly light beer, but the rural aromas of wild yeast offer an interesting drinking experience. The locally grown Spalter Select hop gives subtle grassy notes while spelt and unmalted wheat flakes create a soft, creamy mouthfeel. Weide has a low ABV and a a delicate complexity, making it a highly sessionable beer. Weide is best paired with lighter dishes or served as an aperitif. 4% ABV  [Batch #3: bottled on 1 NOV 2018] [Batch #2: bottled on 19 APR 2018] [Batch #1: bottled on 17 OCT 2017]"
