description: "Weide - Grisette with Hallertau Blanc.  Weide is our dryhopped grisette, fermented with our wild house culture. This second edition is dryhopped with organic Hallertau Blanc, which gives subtle aromas of freshly mowed grass and hay garnished with crisp gooseberries. Light floral notes give the impression of distant fruit trees in bloom. Weide is a refreshing, dry, mildly complex and bitter table beer with a relatively low ABV, making this a very approachable and enjoyable beer year-round.  4% ABV.   [Batch #2: bottled on 19 APR 2018] [Batch #1: bottled on 17 OCT 2017]"
