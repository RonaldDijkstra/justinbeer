description: "This beer is inocculated by wild yeasts (Brettanomyces included) and lactic bacteria. Small, dark and very sweet Damaschine variety plums, also called Ramassin in Piemontese dialect, are added in steeping to restart a new fermentation to characterize the product.  BeerBrugna is matured in oak barrels (3hl or 5hl capacity) for twelve months.   The unique use of Damaschine plums gives to this extraordinary beer a lot of warm and sensuous fruity notes, facing clear, though never too aggressive, sour and citric flavors. Despite its low pH, this unique beer is well balanced thanks to a remarkable fullness and to impressive fruity flavors persisting for a long time.  By Lorenzo Dabove aka Kuaska"
