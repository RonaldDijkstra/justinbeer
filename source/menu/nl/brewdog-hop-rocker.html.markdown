description: "2019 Seasonal.  Hop Rocker is a liquid contradiction. Two become one in this cold fermented, hopped up hybrid. Toast, citrus and hints of spice on the nose.Â Followed by a rich biscuit character with notes of gooseberry, lychee, ans subtle lemon-grass. Sitting on a crisp clean base line - the citrus and peppery notes shine. Slightly pithy to the taste, building to a bitter crescendo and a dry, crisp, long finish.  Hop Rocker - Let the good time roll (again).     "
