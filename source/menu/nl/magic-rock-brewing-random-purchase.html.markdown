description: "Brewed, in collaboration with Alefarm Brewing, Denmark, this DDH IPA, co-pitched with London Fog & California Ale Strain for added depth, is smooth, tropical and moreish. Hopped with the experimental HBC 692, expect tropical fruit aromas on the nose, followed by full, fruity passionfruit and mango flavours on the tongue that gives way to a light pink grapefruit bitterness. The addition of torrified oats and wheat cumulate to allow a sumptuous and smooth mouthfeel to this full flavoured, hazy, hop-bomb.  FLAVOUR PROFILE: Tropical Fruit, Citrus, Pink Grapefruit, Mango"
