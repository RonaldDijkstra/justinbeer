description: "Our Bakewell Sour brewed in collaboration with Wild Beer Co. pours a golden yellow colour with a white head, the beer is refreshingly tart and dry with a combination of citrusy hops and flavours of grapefruit and bitter lemon.   The name Tart is inspired by the Bakewell delicacy where we are based and accurately describes the flavour of the beer in a single word."
