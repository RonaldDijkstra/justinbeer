description: "A modern twist on a classic style. The English ale yeast pumps up the fruitiness. Sorachi Ace hops bring a touch of lemon. It's eeeasy drinking and exxxtra dangerous!  Sebastiaan [Kaintz] â€“ Genius brewmaster and creator of the iconic beers from the old v.Vollenhoven&co brewery. Stubborn, fierce, and a drunk. Naturally, he was fired."
