description: "Double Galaxy New England IPA. The style says it all: this single hop brew showcases the beauty of the Galaxy (hops, that is). Copious quantities of Galaxy are added at several stages of the brew to create this 8% beauty. Deceptively smooth but by no mean subtle, Fueled By Gravity hits your nose with bursting citrus aroma before caressing your palate with clean tropical flavors of mango, and undertones of zesty pineapple and hints of key lime. Experience for yourself what happens when Galaxies collide."
