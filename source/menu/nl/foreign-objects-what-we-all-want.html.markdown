description: "This is a Foreign Objects New-American Hoppy Ale. You can't trust the God you trusted, so trust our waves of flavor instead...Mosaic and Azacca hops give you what you need to fill your time...huge aromas of citrus/grape, kiwi, passionfruit, and resinous American hop intensity spins this wheel!  It's not for lack of trying...could you be happy with something else?  In this case what we want is in fact what we get!"
