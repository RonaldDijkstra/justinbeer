description: "This Double IPA was created for Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2019, and is intended as a celebration of a style and flavour profile we've become synonymous with. Following in the footsteps first laid by our much-loved V series, it's juicy, soft and smooth yet still full-flavoured, bold and bright. To provide full impact, we led with the punchy and distinctive New Zealand hop varietal Nelson Sauvin.  Aroma & Flavour: Powerful notes of fresh pine take the lead, followed by gooseberry, tangerine and lime juice  Body: Full-bodied, juicy and smooth, soft carbonation  Aftertaste: Resinous hop notes, lingering pine and grapefruit zest"
