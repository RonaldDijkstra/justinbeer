description: "As with all of our hoppy beers, we give you more than just a one-dimensional hop bomb.  Malt is there to add more than alcohol, by the way.  And don’t worry, there are enough hops in here to scratch that itch.  This beer gives you everything – all the rich malt and fruit flavours of a Barley Wine combined with the hoppy crispness of a Pale Ale.  In the words of one legend:  Hoppiness = Happiness"
