description: "By adding rose hips to the boil and fresh raspberry puree at the end of fermentation, this kettle-soured beer is a m√©lange of flavors and aromas. With a light ruby hue, subtle raspberry fruit notes greet the nose and fall soft on the palate; tangy, hibiscus-like flavors mingle with the salty tartness of gose to create a uniquely complex and refreshing drinking experience."
