description: "This is the third canned installment in our ongoing hop-forward hazy IPA series, where we change the dry hops with each batch. In this edition we chose to go with with Azacca and El Dorado hops, both known for their juicy tropical fruit aromas. We think it may have magical propertiesâ€¦ Drink fresh! "
