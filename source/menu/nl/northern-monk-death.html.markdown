description: "A 12% imperial stout. Unlike its namesake, you’ll want to invite this one in.  We've only gone and brewed up Death.  An imperial stout at an almighty 12%. Well balanced with rich, decadent chocolate reigning supreme. Blackcurrant and berry notes in the aroma with a touch of plum lingering in the background. It's the stout you need in your life, unlike it's namesake, you'll want to invite this one in.﻿ "
