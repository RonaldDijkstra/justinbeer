description: "Before you stands the Liquid Dessert series, brought to you by Big Belly Brewing. We create sexy beers with big flavors and this series represents all that we stand for. We've asked ourselves what we want to drink on those days that you just really want to indulge in a guilty pleasure. The moments when you're in doubt of ordering a main-course or be real with yourself and order two desserts instead. The times you want to swim in a chocolate fountain or your partner calls you  honey  and your mind can only think  please say - glazed cheesecake - next .    This beer is rich, creamy, smooth, decadent, over the top and full of flavor. Just how you like it.   Big Belly Brewing. More is more. "
