description: "*Bleep*…*Bloop* “Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Over”  ABC me all you want, but I can’t see a thing, it’s so dark! Of course you can’t see a thing! You need to strap on your goggles. They are military grade night vision goggles my friend!  This owlsome imperial / double stout barrel aged in bourbon casks is french oak aged with a peaty twist to it. If you are a fan of heavy dark stouts, than you’ll love this absolute banger. Dark as hell, but tasty as heaven.  Sgt. Nightvision commands you to store this brilliant imperial stout dark and cool, and drink it whenever you want. Drinking it while wearing goggles works best."
