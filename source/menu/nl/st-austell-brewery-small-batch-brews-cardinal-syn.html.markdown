description: "Years of dedication to the monastic brews of the Low Countries have resulted in Cardinal Syn, an Abbey Dubbel brewed in Cornwall.  Brewed with Belgian Abbey ale yeast with dark malts, brown sugar and spiced with a gentle hand, the resultant beer is strong, rich and complex with modest bitterness and dark fruit and treacle aromas."
