description: "Iridescent is an American sour ale that's truly the unique result of our brewers' experimentation with different combinations of dried fruits and spices and feedback from our customers and staff.   Dried apricot and ginger were aged on our blonde sour base ale in wine barrels for 3-4 months to create this refreshing sour ale with aromas of apricot and ginger, followed by tart, tropical flavors.
