description: "We tried, oh we tried, but when the time came to claim a name for this low-threshold session IPA, the first word to pop into our heads was Habbekrats. A beautiful Dutch word that trembles off the tongue like poetry, no? We thought so! In our wonderful guttural dialect it means pittance, which perfectly captures the ridiculously low 1%-ness of this citrusy no-nonsense IPA. Youâ€™ll thank us for that tomorrow."
