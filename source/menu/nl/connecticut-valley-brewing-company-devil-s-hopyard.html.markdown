description: "​Big, bold, but surprisingly smooth, Devil’s Hopyard Imperial NEIPA is bursting with a complex blend of tropical fruit aroma. This 8.6% brew is double dry-hopped with copious amounts of El Dorado, Mosaic, and Citra hops to impart bright tropical flavors with undertones of stone fruit and a hint of watermelon. The devil’s in the details, or in this case, the hopyard."
