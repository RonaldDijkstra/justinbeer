description: "Traditionally produced on the farms of southern Belgium, a ‘Saison’ or ‘Farmhouse Ale’ is the term used for a beer style that was produced on the farms of Wallonia in southern Belgium, brewed with ingredients from the land, after which labourers were paid for their toils in liquid refreshment!  Our Cornish interpretation - ‘Sayzon’ - is brewed with a blend of barley, wheat and oat malts, then gently spiced with ginger, lemon and lime zest. It has a hint of cinnamon and is fermented with a special strain of ‘saison’ yeast to deliver a beer that is assertive but refreshing with a peppery spice and a refreshing citrus finish."
