description: "Jopen Northsea IPA is an IPA (India Pale Ale) or, in old Dutch, a ‘Duraebel Scheepsbier’. These beers were extra strongly brewed and extra hopped so that they could be taken along on the long sea voyages to the Dutch East Indies (current-day Indonesia). Nowadays this type of beer is making a comeback because American brewers have breathed new life into this brewing style. This hoppy amber beer is named after the lake between the towns of Spaarndam and Haarlem, the Mooie Nel (literally: Beautiful Nel). The beer has received an extra hop addition to the tank after fermentation to give it a clear hop character. Silver medal winner Brussels beer Challenge 2014."
