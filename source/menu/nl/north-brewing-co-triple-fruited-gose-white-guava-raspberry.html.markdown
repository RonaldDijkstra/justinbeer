description: "Triple Fruited Gose time! We snuck in a second collab with Stu Mostow from Poland and things got a little fruity in the brewery... This edition is brewed with guava and raspberry and is a little more sour than the previous iterations, with a sharpness from the raspberries. The guava adds a rounded sweetness to the flavour, and the body is thick smoothie goodness. Hurry up Spring sunshine! "
