description: "Sombre Pharos is the result of our Russian Imperial Stout, Black Oktober, after 6 months interred in Islay Whisky barrels. We wanted to create a beer of two halves, so we contrasted this mix with Tonka beans. They dominate the aroma with a thick wash of cinnamon, vanilla, and tart cherry. Smoke manifests immediately on the tongue to balance against the Tonkan might and the finish is long and thick moulder of toasted, spiced almonds.  "
