description: "Duits&Lauret; Blond is an extremely refreshing and complex thirst-quencher. A lot of floral and citrus notes can be discerned in its aroma. Because of the large quantity of aromatic hop varieties used. All this in combination with a pleasant bitterness. Due to these distinct characteristics this beer can be enjoyed on its own but also goes well with a variety of dishes. Combining it with refreshing salads and white fish produces beautiful sensations to the palate."
