description: "Brett IPA.   This is the second edition of our collaboration with Jasper Yeast and his wild yeast harvested and isolated in Virginia, USA.   The 2019 edition uses his yeast with Framgarden Kveik and adds a different selection of hops.  A definite funky & fruity beast that is a must-taste for any brett-head.
