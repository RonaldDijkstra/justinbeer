description: "This Roggen-Doppel Sticke decandent hybrid has a plethora of combinated flavours. A deadly carnival dancing in the mouth: toasty caramel followed by the wild spiciness of the rye, roasty taste from the grains, and all the balance of the german hops ending the cortege.    West Coast is dead."
