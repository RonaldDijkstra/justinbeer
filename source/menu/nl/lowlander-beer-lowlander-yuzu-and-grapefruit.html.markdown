description: "A botanically brewed infusion of yuzu, pink grapefruit, Earl Grey tea and gose beer. Light and refreshing, with bright citrus flavours.  ----  Trade routes from the far east introduced new wonders to the west, capturing the imagination with exotic citrus treasures that lay beyond the well-trodden paths.  Our uplifting and zesty infusion of yuzu, pink grapefruit and earl grey tea, will transport you there in an instant.  ----  Our new range casts herbs, spices and real fruit in a starring role. We take the finest ingredients like ginger, yuzu, kaffir lime leaves and grapefruit and infuse these with natural teas and beer, to create a lightly alcoholic (2.5% alc.) yet full flavoured drink."
