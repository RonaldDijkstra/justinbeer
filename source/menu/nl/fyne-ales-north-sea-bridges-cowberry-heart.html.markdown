description: "Sour red rye IPA packed full of lingonberries (also know as cowberries). It's a fusion of full-bodied malts and spicy rye with a puckeringly tart finish thanks to the lingonberries - they're sharp and acidic and really give a zing to the beer. It's a modest 5.3% - the lowest in the NSB collection - and ideal for Summer smashing"
