description: "The second in a series of collaborations ahead of our first festival, Friends & Family & Beer. This unusual beer, created with Evil Twin, fuses a tart, fruity kettle sour with the dryness and complex acidity of Champagne. We did this by blending a passion fruit, mango and pineapple sour with a grape juice-infused Brut IPA fermented using Champagne yeast.  Aroma & Flavour: Passion fruit leads, supported by pineapple, mango and grape, Buck's Fizz character, complex acidity Body: Light and dry, with prickling carbonation Aftertaste: Dry, Champagne-like finish with lasting grape notes"
