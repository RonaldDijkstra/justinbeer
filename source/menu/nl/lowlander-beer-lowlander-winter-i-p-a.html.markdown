description: "Brewed with spruce needles & juniper berries. A crisp white i.p.a. with hoppy notes and a resinous citrus kick  ---  During the height of the so-called Little Ice Age, the bitterly harsh winters caused canals and rivers to freeze. Amid bone-chilling temperatures people turned from wine to beer as grains were greater survivors of cold than grapes.  In tribute to going against the grape, we go against the grain by crafting a White IPA rather than the typical dark beers common in the winter months.   We dare you to go against the grain too, gifting the initials of your loved ones in bottles of refreshing Winter IPA instead of chocolate letters."
