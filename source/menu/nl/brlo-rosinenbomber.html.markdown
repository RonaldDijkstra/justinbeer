description: "This collaborative brew was inspired by the valiant efforts of the allied pilots who supplied 2.3 million tonnes of essential goods to the citizens of Berlin during the Berlin Blockade and Mr. Gail Halverson, affectionately known as ‘The Chocolate Bomber’, whose actions led to ‘Operation Little Vittles’. Rosinenbomber delivers an impressive payload of rich dark chocolate, dried fruit, vanilla, and cocoa nibs, and is guaranteed to evoke a child like excitement in those lucky enough to cross its path."
