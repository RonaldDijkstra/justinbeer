description: "Alesong brewing specialise in brewing wild and barrel-aged beers in Oregon in the USA. They have produced multiple award-winning beers since they started in 2015 and we were incredibly honoured to have the opportunity to work with them for this collaboration.  Isle of Avalon was fermented in foudre on apple pomace from Burrowhill Cider Farm. The complexity and depth of the beer comes from being matured in the Kingâ€™s Estate barrels, all the way from the pacific North West of the USA."
