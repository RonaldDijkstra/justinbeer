description: "Think Holland and you thin of sex, drugs, Vincent, Johan and Anne. What you don’t think of, is caravans. But you should, because no one does caravans quite like the dutch do caravans. Each summer the nation retreats en masse to the mediterranean’s balmy  hores, pulling with them rolling homes filled with locally brewed beer. So for them we are bringing back our summertime classic: F*ck The Caravan Is On Fire! This 5,5% wheat pale ale brewed with mosaic and simcoe hops can’t help but be the king of the campsite. And remember, if your caravan catches on fire, don’t panic. Just slowly exit you vehicle, grab a beach chair and watch that baby burn! Holland is a welfare state after all, everything is insured. Caravans included."
