description: "Here is a fatherâ€™s toast to his son. Brewed with cocoa nibs and lactose, Hunter boasts a creamy texture and rich chocolate flavor. Vanilla, roast, and caramel sweetness are met with a bright hop bitterness. Complex enough to pair with dinner or dessert. Suave enough to skip the meal altogether. A chip off the old block, alright."
