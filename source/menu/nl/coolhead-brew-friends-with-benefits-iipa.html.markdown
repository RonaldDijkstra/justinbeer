description: "CoolHead x TUJU - Friends With Benefits IIPA 8.5%  This Imperial India Pale Ale is brewed in collaboration with our friends from the east - Panimoyhti√∂ Tuju, Lappeenranta. Not only is this beer hazy and juicy and brings out all that goodness from the Citra, Vic Secret, Enigma and Mosaic hops - it's also dry and bitter as a proper DIPA should be. To be enjoyed with your friends. With benefits."
