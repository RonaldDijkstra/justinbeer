description: "Built to sit somewhere between West and East coast, our Symbiosis series focuses on the idea of building on what we knew about hops and how they compliment and contrast against each other.  Pupa is the next stage in the evolution.  We're taking the hops from the limelight and moving towards the yeasts that play just an important role in flavour.  Expect masses of tropical fruits bursting from the can as hops and yeast dance to create a sensual panoply of aromas.  Oats lend a luxurious mouthfeel and low bitterness helps to accentuate this beer into a long and juicy finish.  "
