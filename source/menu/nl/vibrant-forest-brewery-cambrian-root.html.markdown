description: "542 Million years ago the Cambrian Explosion began, an evolutionary expansion unrivalled in speed, scope and importance.  From the primordial murk came forth the ancestral forms of most life as we know it.    At first, all is darkness. Thick chocolate and coffee notes swirl about the pallet.  However, all tastes are rapidly encompassed by the roar of blinding liquorice.   The Root of the Cambrian Explosion is laid bare, the flavour sensation has brought forth the pathway to our human transcendence.  Drink deep, and be taken back to the Cambrian Root. "
