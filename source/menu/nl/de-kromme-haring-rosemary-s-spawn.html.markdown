description: "It is always fun to have the Yeastie Boys over! Sam, Stu & JK brew a mean beer and are not afraid to experiment. Together we let our imagination (and our beer) run wild. Rosemaryâ€™s Spawn is a Gose-style beer fermented with the delicious and unpredictable Mudking yeast/bacteria blend. We added copious amounts of fresh rosemary and Indian coriander seeds. It is a tart and very refreshing beer with unique spiciness with notes of ginger, lemon and pine."
