description: "Metro is a New England style Pale Ale.  For this batch it’s been fermented with Vermont Ale yeast for big stone fruit esters and liberally hopped with El Dorado, Idaho 7 and Azacca hops.  On top of all this, we’ve added a new product to the mix – “Hop Hash”.  They’re condensed hop resins that make for super dank, intensely oily and sticky fruit finish.  Goes well with lazy nights and hot mornings.  Featuring Josh, one of our brewers in the making."
