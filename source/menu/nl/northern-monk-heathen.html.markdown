description: "A bold yet balanced New England IPA. Soft, resinous and tropical. For the Heathens.  The American-bred Citra hops made its splash into the industry with a bang, taking over the craft brewing scene by storm with its otherworldly tropical fruit flavour and aroma. Our take on this juicy hop takes the best of its exceptional characteristics to brew a bold yet balanced IPA. A simple base of British pale malt is coloured by small kettle additions of our UK and US hops blend for a soft, fruity bitterness. Come dry hopping time, we hit high gear with 16kg of Citra spread over three additions, layering them into the beer for the ultimate juicy, resinous taste experience and an aroma of tropical fruit that lures your olfactory sense from across the room."
