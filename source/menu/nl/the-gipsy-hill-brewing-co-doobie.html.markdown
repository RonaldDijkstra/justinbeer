description: "Doobie is a passion fruit Gose.  Soured over 4 days in the kettle using our house lacto-strain and salted in the boil with Pink Himalayan rock salt.  It was fermented through before being blended with a mountain of passion fruit.  Itâ€™s a BBQ summer party in a can. Puckeringly sour, delightfully salty and beautifully fruity.  Goes well with L-I-V-I-N.  Featuring Kate, Taproom ace and general beer hound."
