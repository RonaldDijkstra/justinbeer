description: "Brewed with Curacao orange, elderflower and chamomile. Refreshing & crisp with a fruity, flower finish.  ----  When Willem Barentsz attempted to navigate the Northeast passage, his crew fought twin terrors: polar bears and frozen beer. Our White Ale, with its refreshing fruity notes, is a tribute to the restless and rugged spirit that kept Barentsz going.   "
