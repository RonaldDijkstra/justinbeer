description: "Our anniversary beer is an American-style barley wine, aged in a variety of spirit and wine barrels before being blended back together with a percentage of fresh beer to create each year's vintage. Maiden 2018 has a beautiful aroma of caramel, almond and oak with some fruit notes, giving way to flavours of vanilla, raisin, spice, sherry, nuttiness and a delicate hop bitterness. It drinks smoothly with a soft mouthfeel, warming sensation and a long, complex finish."
