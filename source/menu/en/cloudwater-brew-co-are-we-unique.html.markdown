description: "This is our interpretation of a modern Imperial IPA, combining the pithy bitterness and dry finish that are hallmarks of West Coast Imperial IPAs, with sticky, juicy fruit flavours more readily associated with a hazy DIPA. It's brewed to be impactful and uncompromising, yet remarkably easy-drinking and clean.  Aroma & Flavour: Sticky pineapple, passion fruit and papaya, giving way to mandarin zest and resinous pine  Body: Medium-bodied with a long, dry finish  Aftertaste: Lasting bitterness full of pithy grapefruit, lingering pine notes"
