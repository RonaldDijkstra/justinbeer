description: "Some India Pale Ales require warning labels. Like: Danger! This bad boy is a real pucker-pusher. Or: Caution! Quaff confidently but with care. Cascade Green Sweater just happens to be one of those rare brews that demands a footnote*. Seriously, this heroically bitter IPA might actually make you cry.  Brewed exclusively with uber-aromatic Cascade hops plucked from the dark damp forests of the Pacific Northwest, this IIPA will actively seek out all your drillable dental soft spots. Oh dear! Drink cautiously, you hear?  *Best drunk outside. In the rain. Wearing your favorite green grunge sweater. With the tooth fairy. "
