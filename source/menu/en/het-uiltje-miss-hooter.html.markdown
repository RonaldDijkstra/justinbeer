description: "She is so silky smooth, light smooth and light on her feet. If it looks like it can’t get any better, it get’s better. She’s also low maintenance. The only thing you have to do is to drink her fresh or keep her cold and out of the sun, because if you don’t… Her hoppy side gets really upset!!"
