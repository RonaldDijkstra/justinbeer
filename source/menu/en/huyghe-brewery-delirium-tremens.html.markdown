description: "NB: Depending on the location and batch, this beer can be either 8.5% or 8.7%. Please do not post an edit request asking to change it from one to the other.  The allusion to pink elephants and the choice of names is not due to chance. With a particular character, the unique taste of  results from the use of three different kinds of yeast. The result is a finish of peppery bitterness without aggression. The gray bottle hides a mystery awaiting discovery by the none faint of heart."
