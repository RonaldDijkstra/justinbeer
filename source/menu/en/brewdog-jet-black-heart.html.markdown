description: "Jet Black Heart is a 4.7% milk stout, loaded with oatmeal for an extra lush mouth-feel and nitro dispensed on draft; expect decadent cacao, subtle roastiness, and autumnal fruitiness with a dark seductive edge. Inspired by some of the awesome craft nitro stouts we tried in the US we wanted to put our own spin on the style and also introduce nitro beers to BrewDog bars."
