description: "A new Tokyo* recipe was created in 2014 to produce a lower ABV at 16.5%. The 18.2% caused a lot of stress on the yeast. With the new recipe we have created a beer that ferments better and is packed full of more flavour than the original.  Tokyo* is a beer inspired by a 1980's space invaders arcade game played in Japan's capital.  The irony of existentialism, the parody of being and the inherent contradictions of post-modernism, all so delicately conveyed by the blocky, pixelated arcade action have all been painstakingly recreated in this bottles contents.  This imperial stout is brewed with copious amounts of speciality malts, jasmine and cranberries. After fermentation we then dry-hop this killer stout with a bucketload of our favourite hops before carefully ageing the beer on French toasted oak chips.  It is all about moderation. Everything in moderation, including moderation itself. What logically follows is that you must, from time, have excess. This beer is for those times.  Malts: Marris Otter, Dark Crystal, Caramalt, Chocolate Malt, Roast Barley.  Hops: Galena"
