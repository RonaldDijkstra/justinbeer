description: "Pale ale basically originates from England, but we have brewed it in our own way. It was designed with the idea of a very tasty, aromatic and balanced beer. The base of the beer is formed by a relatively simple combination of the basic and caramelised malts. This base was then overlaid with 4 types of hops that give it a fresh, fruity aroma and a superbly refreshing taste, which together with the malt base creates highly balanced and dangerously drinkable ale."
