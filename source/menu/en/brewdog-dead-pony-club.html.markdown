description: "Get ready to gun it down the Pacific Coast Highway through a hop-heavy west-coast wonderland.  This ale is chopped, tuned and ready to roll.  Bright and bracing, Dead Pony* has been crafted from an insane amount of west coast hops to deliver massive citrus aromas. Dive in and the toasted malt base soon gives way to a huge box-fresh hop hit washing tropical fruit, floral hits and spicy undertones all over your palate.  This is a session ale with balls of equine proportions. Laidback, but hop-forward. California dreaming for the craft beer generation.  *no ponies were harmed in the making of this beer.  Malts: Cara, Crystal, Extra Pale  Hops: Simcoe, Citra and Mosaic"
