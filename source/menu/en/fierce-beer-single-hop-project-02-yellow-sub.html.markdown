description: "This California Common pays homage to the great Steam Beers of West Coast USA. Bronze/golden in colour with a malty backbone, complimented by Yellow Sub hops which impart floral/citrus notes. This was brewed with the amazing team from Jopen who have been crafting awesome beer in Haarlem, NL since 1992."
