description: "For our first beer brewed at our brewpub, we decided on a simple, yet classic recipe and style. An American Amber to us is all about how a soft body with biscuity, caramel flavours works with a subtle if present hop aroma and soft bitterness. Chinook and Cascade are classics for this style and to accentuate the softness we deliberately reduced the co2 to create a velvety texture.  The second batch (04-17) replaces Chinook with Falconer's Flight  Style: American Amber 5,5% ABV Malts: Pale, Munich, Crystal, Biscuit,  Hops: Warrior, Chinook, Cascade Yeast: Fullers"
