description: "Summit, as a stand alone hop, is very under represented in the brewing world.  Often relegated to bittering, or lost among other varietals, it doesn't often get to shine.  This ends here.  Immediate blasts of juicy, resinous citrus assault the palate.  Orange dominates the flavour, and lends its pith to a long and bitey finish. "
