description: "A decadent liquid desert constructed of fresh Raspberries, warm chocolate and liquoricey treacle your nose is filled with warm, sticky comforting flavours. The palate goes deeper and more complex with a heady hit of sweet raspberry tartness, bitter dark Javan chocolate burnt vanilla and nutty caramel notes that lead to a long lingering finish of bitter fresh vanilla pods, raspberries and a dusting of cocoa. Pure gluttony.  "
