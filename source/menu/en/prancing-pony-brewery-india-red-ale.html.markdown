description: "This big and bold India Red Ale, this beer has won a Supreme Champion Trophy at the International beer Challenge in London in 2016.  It is a bold beer and one of our most passionate beer creations.  Generous caramel characters form the backbone of that extra long flavour. Intense, yet balanced hop bitterness with a big hop aroma, packed with citrus, passionfruit and tropical ale characters. A strong, full bodied and balanced Ale that hits you with flavours."
