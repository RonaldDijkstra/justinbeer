description: "This is one old school beer, no modern varieties, no modern yeasts, just plain old cascade columbus beer. Quite high but pleasant bitterness, with grapefruit and piney notes. I guess we all have to grow up at some point of time, but we want to brew a homage to this style that started it all. P.S. we're not growing up, we are just growing horizontally."
