description: "Brewed with coriander seeds and white tea. Fruity, citrusy and bitter, with a refreshing, lingering spice.   ---  Dutch seafarers returning from the east would often bring back monkeys, which they would sell to tavern-keepers to pay off drinking debts. Our IPA, with its hints of botanicals and spice, is a tribute to those sailors' spirit of adventure and quick thinking. "
