description: "A dark as a lunar eclipse and as big as a planet, this stout means business. Vanilla and caramel on the nose gives way to a black hole of flavour. Layers of toasty marshmallow, vanilla and nutty caramelised sugar orbit a biscuity base. The milk sugar sweetness is deftly balanced by cocoa nib bitterness."
