description: "Champion Winter Beer of Britain 2004, and one of Roger Protz’s “300 Beers To Try Before You Die”.  This cult ale is one for the connoisseur! A rich, dark, full – bodied old ale that really has to be tasted to be appreciated.  This beer is usually the first to sell out at beer festivals, thanks to its blend of Pale, Lager, Crystal, Wheat and Black malts that are fermented with an English yeast.  Bramling Cross hops are added to provide a hint of orange and a balancing dose of bitterness."
