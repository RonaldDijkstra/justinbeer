description: "Batallas Double Stout 2/3. Aged in rum barrels.  Batallas is the first instalment of our barrel ageing project from the Bermondsey Vault. The three varieties are from a single brew. The first is the original expression of the Double Stout. The other two have spent much of this year maturing in rum and whisky barrels. Each barrel has come from renowned independent spirit makers from across Europe to introduce diverse and complex flavours to the rarely seen style of beer. The beers from the rum and whisky barrels have been enhanced by the flavours from wood and the spirit that was previously within.  We collaborated with La Quince to brew this beer with our mutual friend Batallas. We all love dark beers full of flavour that are immensely drinkable. It was a pleasure to share our first Vault projects with friends like these."
