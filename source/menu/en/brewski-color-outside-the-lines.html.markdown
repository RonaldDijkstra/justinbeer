description: "TO THINK OR ACT IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT CONFORM TO SET RULES. LIKENED TO THE WAY A CHILD MIGHT COLOR OUTSIDE THE LINES OF A COLORING BOOK. THIS BEER CAME TO LIFE IN THE SAME WAY. YOU CAN’T ALWAYS PUT THE COLOR INSIDE LINES. SURE, IT MIGHT LOOK NICER, BUT IT’S BORING AND WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT REAL CRAFTSMANSHIP COMES WHEN YOU START BENDING THE RULES. WE GIVE YOU A NEW ENGLAND IPA WITH LOTS OF PINEAPPLE, STRAWBERRIES & LIME."
