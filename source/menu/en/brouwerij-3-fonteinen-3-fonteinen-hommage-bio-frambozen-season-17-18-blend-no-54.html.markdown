description: "This particular Hommage has macerated for 5.5 months on a 2,000 litre oak foeder and with 280 kilos of sour cherries and 837 kilos of organic raspberries. The fi nal fruit intensity is 372 grams of fruit per litre of Hommage. 100% 3 Fonteinen.  3 Fonteinen Hommage is the result of macerating hand-picked whole sour cherries and raspberries on young lambic for at least four months, in a proportion of 760 to 800 grams of raspberries and 200 to 240 grams of sour cherries per litre of lambic. This fruit lambic is then blended again with more lambic to obtain a minimum intensity of 35% fruit. Hommage is a bodied raspberry lambic beer, with an intense deep red forest fruit bouquet. This unfiltered and unpasteurised lambic is all-natural with no artificial juices, syrups, or sugars added."
