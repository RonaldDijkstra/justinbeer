description: "Imperial stout aged in bourbon and marsala barrels for 12 months, then blended together.  The only way to describe the development of this beer would be to compare it to that time we poured 2 tonnes of dates from the door of a stunt plane into a chocolate river flowing through a vineyard in Sicily.  Suitable for vegetarians.  Contains lactose."
