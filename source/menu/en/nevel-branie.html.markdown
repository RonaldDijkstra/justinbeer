description: "Branie - Wild blonde ale aged on bourbon barrels.  Expect nothing short of crazy from this collab with our friends of Van Moll. Their big mouth and our wild nature proved to be the perfect ingredients for a beer that flies off the trodden path.  Branie is a fresh blonde ale with a feisty bourbon temper. It was brewed with reckless amounts of locally grown rye, giving it an especially full and creamy mouthfeel.  Plenty of ripe fruit in the nose, mostly apple, apricot and peach. The taste also offers coconut, vanilla and a hint of almond. The finish is long with a warm bourbon character and a slight burn in the throat. Branie is a colourful cacophony, but still very soft and palatable like a true Nevel. Feel like going wild? Kick up some Branie with us. 6.1% ABV  [Batch #1: bottled on 15 MAY 2019]"
