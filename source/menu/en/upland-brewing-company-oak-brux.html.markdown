description: "Oak Brux is fermented with 100% brettanomyces bruxellensis yeast and aged four eight months in barrels made from no toast French oak heads and medium long toast American oak staves. Brett produces mild tartness and fruity esters, which blend with the oaky vanillans and pleasant funk character. We appreciate the simplicity of this pale, hazy,4.5% abv beer,as an example of the American craft beer movement. "
