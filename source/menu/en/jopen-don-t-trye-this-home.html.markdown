description: "This collaboration brew with Lervig Brewery is brewed to honour a brewing grain that we both love: RYE. We like it so much that we decided to create a rye wine, in the barley wine-style. Full-bodied, sweet, strong, but with rye flavor characteristics. And believe it or not, this beer contains 70% rye malt! Donâ€™t tRYE this @home!! "
