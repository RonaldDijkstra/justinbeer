description: "We teamed up with Against the Grain for the seventh in a series of collaborations celebrating our first festival, Friends & Family & Beer, to brew a smoked beer that doesn't fit typical style guidelines. It has a complex malt base akin to an Old Ale, including malt we smoked ourselves using wood from bourbon barrels, but was fermented using a clean lager yeast."
