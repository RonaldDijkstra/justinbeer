description: "Niki Citra Pale is our attempt at finding the perfect balance between the hoppiness of an IPA and the drinkability of a pale ale. Resting at 5.5 % abv and meditatively hopped with our single most favorite hop - Citra - it drinks as beautifully on its own as it does paired with fatty foods such as a pizza or a burger. Sit back, sip back and relax. Cheers.  Henok "
