description: "Bries - Barrel-aged Golden Sour with Sea Buckthorn.  Bries is a refreshing blend of golden sours that were aged on oak for 6 months. Lush fruit acids are tempered by warm, round notes of oranges and an elegant piny finish. Its creamy, silky bubbles and light woody notes almost make it feel like a champagne. The sea buckthorn berries were added with their branches, creating extra deep flavours with mild tannins. Bries is the perfect beer for those moments when you seek a bit of refreshment, or need a cool breeze to lift your spirits. 6.2% ABV.  [Batch #1: bottled on 14 JUN 2018]"
