description: "Oude Geuze Boon Black Label is the driest gueuze we've ever made. Combining a full-bodied taste with nearly 100% fermentation degree was a big challenge. This gueuze has a clear golden body with lively carbonation, balanced sourness and flavors of green apple and grapefruit. This is finished off with a long bone-dry aftertaste. The Lambics used for this blend have aged for 1, 2, and 3 years on oak casks. Brewed in Lembeek, the village that gave Lambic its name. "
