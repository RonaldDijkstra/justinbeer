description: "Created for Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2019, this Double IPA is single-hopped with Citra and combines the hot-side hop profile of a classic West Coast Imperial IPA with the cold-side hop profile and yeast from our signature DIPA. This marriage of styles creates a beer that's sweet and juicy, but with a resinous bitterness that lingers long into the finish.  Aroma & Aftertaste: Juicy tangerine, honeydew melon and orange zest  Body: Full-bodied, juicy and smooth but with a drying finish, soft carbonation  Aftertaste: Long pithy bitterness, tingling resinous hop notes "
