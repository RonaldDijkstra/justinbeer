description: "Pais Tropical 2018 is our take on a light, easy, super hoppy and fruity IPA. Dry and late hopping with Simcoe, Citra, Mosaic and Mandarina Bavaria bring the tropical, yellow and citrus fruit flavour and aroma. These flavours are backed up by with a more expressive yeast strain. The pale malt base is lighter but still provides a smooth mouthfeel provided by  the use of sufficient wheat and oats.  "
