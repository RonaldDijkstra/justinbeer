description: "Forêt Blanc is a collaboration between Oersoep and JanotsBos, a winery in Meursault, Burgundy.  Experience an amazing interplay between the three months aging on Meursault barrels and the use of Hallertau blanc hops. This farmhouse ale is hazy, with a golden colour and mild carbonation. Flavour of peaches, vanilla and honey, a creamy mouthfeel followed with aromas of peaches and vanilla. "
