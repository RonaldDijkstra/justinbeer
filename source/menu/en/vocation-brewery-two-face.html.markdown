description: "SPECIAL RELEASE SERIES 4 of 12.  Brace yourself for this multi-faceted IPA. Its juicy body and fruity profile of peaches and citrus are delivered by Galaxy and Simcoe hops, whilst Columbus hops bring a dank and resinous aroma. Donâ€™t be fooled by its juicy taste, this double IPA bites back."
