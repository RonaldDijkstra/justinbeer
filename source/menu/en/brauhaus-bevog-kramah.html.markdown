description: "Kramah, shows off its hops muscles. We used an insane dose of highly fruity, aromatic hops, which gives the beer a strong aroma of mango, lychee, citruses and a bunch of other tropical fruits. The taste continues along this manner, then the elder components reveal themselves and continue into a bitterness that reminds one of biting into a fresh, juicy grapefruit. A very simple, yet effective combination of malts provides enough support so the bitterness does not rip out your tongue."
