description: "Signature Edition #3. There is no train track in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, so the hype train arrived with some delay. But we've reached the platform with film collective BRUUT, from Antwerpen, as our travel partners. Our extremely dry Brut IPA is surprisingly fresh, due to the additions of peach and fruity hops. The perfect coalescence of Brut and IPA.   Check out the film our friends from BRUUT Collective made for this beer >>  www.bruutcollective.com/IPA"
