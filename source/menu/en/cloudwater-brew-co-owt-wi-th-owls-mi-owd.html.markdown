description: "The fifth in a series of collaborations ahead of our first festival, Friends & Family & Beer was brewed with Garage Beer Co from Barcelona. Owt wi’ th’Owls Mi Owd? is an elderberry and grape sour, dry hopped with New Zealand hops. As a result, it has a distinct white wine character with notes of white grape, gooseberry and grapefruit backed up by red berry flavours."
