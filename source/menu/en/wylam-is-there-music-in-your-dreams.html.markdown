description: "19.1° Plato | OG 1079.1 | ABV 8.2%  DIPA... A transatlantic DIPA brewed with New York’s superb OTHER HALF. Peerlessly soft bodied with a grist built up of extra pale Bamburg Pilsner malt, chit and variant oat flakes. Juiced up to paramount levels of tropical crush with Ella, Enigma, Idaho 7 and Denali distributing deep notes of pineapple, papaya and mango and soaring high notes of lime, lemon and orange zest."
