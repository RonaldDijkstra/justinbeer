description: "16.5Â° Plato | OG 1067.1 | ABV 6.5%  Follow the dehumanised, proselytising hordes into a nihilistic, tyrannical, dehumanised environmental disaster, but before you do.... Have a draught on our new Uber fresh IPA!  Soft and bouncy on the palate with liberal doses of IDAHO 7, AZZECA and CITRA CRYO transmitting super clean levels of tropical crush and ripe fleshy dankness."
