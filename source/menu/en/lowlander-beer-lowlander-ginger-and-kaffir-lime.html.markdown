description: "A botanically brewed infusion of ginger, kaffir lime leafs, cardamom, Darjeeling tea and wheat beer. Spicy and aromatic with hints of zesty citrus.  ----  As the Dutch traded spices the world over, they discovered that ginger was the secret zing that gave food in the east its curious kick.  Our aromatic and curious blend fuses the exotic notes of ginger, kaffir lime, cardamom and Darjeeling tea into a spicy refreshing blend that can tame the heat of the hottest of days.  ----  Our new range casts herbs, spices and real fruit in a starring role. We take the finest ingredients like ginger, yuzu, kaffir lime leaves and grapefruit and infuse these with natural teas and beer, to create a lightly alcoholic (2.5% alc.) yet full flavoured drink."
