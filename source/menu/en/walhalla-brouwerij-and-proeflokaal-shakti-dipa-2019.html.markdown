description: "This Double IPA is the beloved beer of the mother goddess Shakti, which we brewed from day one. After three years we're updating the recipe, doubling the amount of Columbus and Simcoe dryhops while reducing the bitterness and ABV. She's mysteriously smooth and overwhelms you with seductive hop aromas.  Exclusively available on can and draft to guarantee freshness."
