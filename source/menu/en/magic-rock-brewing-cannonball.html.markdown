description: "Cannonball is an India Pale Ale in the true tradition, high in alcohol and massively hopped to survive a long sea voyage.   We donâ€™t want you to wait though, crack the cap and let the flavour explode on your palate. Tropically fruity, resinous hops compete against a sweet malty backbone, while a rasping bitterness builds to a mouth puckering crescendo.  Our hop bomb might just blow you away!"
