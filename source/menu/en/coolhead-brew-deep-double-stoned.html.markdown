description: "We use literally tons of fruit when making our DEEP series beers. This one is a Double Stone Fruited Imperial Berliner Weisse brewed with insane amount of peach & apricots. Soured with our house lacto culture, we also added a good chunk of oats and milk sugar for extra creaminess. Store cold and drink fresh!"
