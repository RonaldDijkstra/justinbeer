description: "Brewed with cocoa, coffee and Lactose this beer will excite the coffee nerd and the stout geek inside you. Packaged with Nitro this beer should be poured vigorously into the proper glass to cascade the beer into a finaly packed fluffy whipped cream head, giving the beer a lush mouthfeel and thickness from the lactose and nitro, yet surprisingly light and easy to sip. Flavors of Mocha, chocolate and roasty goodness all the way through. This beer is the first of many brewed with Nitro from Lervig."
