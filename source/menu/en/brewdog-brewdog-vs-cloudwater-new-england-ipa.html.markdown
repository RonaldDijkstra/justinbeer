description: "BrewDog vs Cloudwater is a 6.8% Vermont-style India Pale Ale, hopped with Mosaic in the whirlpool only. Without any big-hitting additions of hops in the boil, we carried the flavour by heavily dry-hopping the brew with Citra and Mosaic. Topping out at around 35IBU, we also used oats in the recipe to deliver the trademark smooth mouthfeel â€“ and made it truly authentic by propagating a one-off culture of Vermont yeast, specifically for the brew.  Malts: Pale Ale Propino, torrefied wheat and oats  Hops: Mosaic and Citra  Yeast: Vermont Ale (WLP4000)"
