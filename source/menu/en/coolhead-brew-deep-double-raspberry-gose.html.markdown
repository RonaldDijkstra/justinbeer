description: "We use literally tons of fruit when making our DEEP series beers. This one is a Double Fruited Imperial Gose brewed with insane amount of raspberry puree. Soured with our house lacto culture and seasoned with Pink Himalayan salt, we also added a good chunk of oats for extra creaminess. Store cold and drink fresh!"
