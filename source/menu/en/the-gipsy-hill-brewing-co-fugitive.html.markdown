description: "Fugitive is a Fruited Brut IPA, and a collaboration with Verdant Brewing Co.  It’s a big, bold beer. It’s been fermented way down low, in Brut style, then liberally dry-hopped with Nelson Sauvin and Vic Secret, before being brought right back up to life again with bucket-loads of passion fruit, mango, peach and pineapple puree."
