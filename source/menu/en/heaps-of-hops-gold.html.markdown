description: "GOLDEN ALE – 3.5% VOL – WINNER SILVER MEDAL BRUSSELS BEER CHALLENGE –  A fresh Golden Ale to quench your thirst on a bright day. This fairly dry, golden coloured ale retains some smooth bitterness, subtly combined with a fresh aroma of citrus from the fine tuned blend of Citra, Cascade and Magnum hops."
