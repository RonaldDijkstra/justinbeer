description: "Luciferin is our monument to those bright and ephemeral flashes that light the deep. The aroma blends chocolate with tart lime; it's heavy, and oozes up the glass. On the tongue is an immediate assault of juiced lime which coalesces around the tart and salty gose broth. Our darkened base lends a whisper more of chocolate, before the experience sinks back to the depths. "
