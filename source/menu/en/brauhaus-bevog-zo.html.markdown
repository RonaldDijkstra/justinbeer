description: "Bevog Zo is a playful and vibrant Session IPA, which has a distinctive tropical and citrus character with grapefruit, passion fruit, stone fruits and lime notes. The soft malt backbone combined with oatmeal gives it a finely balanced body. Huge amounts of very fruity American and Australian hops, added through the process of brewing and maturating, turn this beer into a magnificent hop party with amazingly balanced hop bitterness and all that packed into a slim alcohol level.. It is a beer for every day, at any time..."
