description: "We decided to test our Mash filter by brewing our interpretation of an Old English Wheat Wine. So we took Wheat malt and Crystal wheat malt and soem unmalted wheat and 2 English hops; Endeavour and Bullion. To top it of we added sage and daisy in the whirlpool and waited for magic to happen. Expect a big brew, with loads of wheat flavour, but also hoppiness and flowers. And it fun to play around with the possibilities that the brew house supplies us with."
