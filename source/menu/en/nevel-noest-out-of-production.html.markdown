description: "Noest - Vatted Porter with Brettanomyces.  Please note that for legal reasons, we have changed the name of Noest to Tumult. The beer recipe is still the same. Tumult is expected to be available in fall 2019.   Old description: Noest is our vatted porter that was aged in a stainless steel fermenter for 6 months. It is a dark, mildly sour beer with delicate notes of toasted bread, cacao and red fruit. It was fermented with a traditional English yeast and matured with Brettanomyces, which gives this beer its exciting vinous character. Noest tastes like a love affair between a porter and a Flemish red, which is not so strange if you consider that Flemish red is actually derived from early porters. Where modern porters are usually quite sweet and full, Noest is subtle and dry and that's exactly how we want it to be: a beer that will lift you up and quench your thirst when you come home from work, be it summer or winter!  4,9% ABV.   [Batch #1: bottled on 15 MAY 2018] "
