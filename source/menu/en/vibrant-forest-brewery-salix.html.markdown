description: "Salix is number 7 in our Symbiosis range, a group of beers that explores the interplay between both well known and experimental hops.  In Salix, Hallertau Blanc was paired with Centennial resulting in a surprisingly clean pale ale. There's mango in abundance, with mandarin and grapefruit. It's crisp, not syrupy, and this leads into a very refreshing, lightly bittered, pink grapefruit laden finish."
