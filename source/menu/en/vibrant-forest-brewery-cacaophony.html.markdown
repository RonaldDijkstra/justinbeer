description: "In Cacaophony, we set out to brew pudding. Potent, unadulterated chocolate pudding. We went mad on the oats to create a thick, decadent mouthfeel. The nose is pure Bruge, all roasty chocolate warmth. The body follows suit with a thick broth of milk chocolate and softly roasted malts accentuate this opulent brew. "
