description: "Kiwi is a fruited sour ale that showcases the distinct fruit characteristics of fresh kiwis melded with a mildly tart base of sour blonde ale. Hazy and golden/straw in appearance upon pouring, with zesty amounts of carbonation. Its fresh kiwi and tropical aromas meld with floral and wine-like notes. Wonderful rich kiwi flavors follow in the taste, accompanied by refreshing tartness. The finish is dry, with mouthwatering tanginess and kiwi flavor."
