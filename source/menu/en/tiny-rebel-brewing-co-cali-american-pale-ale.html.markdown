description: "Bigger than the beef between the Bloods and the Crips. We bring you a beer that's hopped to sh*t. Reppin' from the 'Port to Rodeo Drive. Juicy and fresh, Cali has arrived. West Side! Our American Pale Ale is inspired by the rough and ready of the West Coast. Things aren’t always sunshine and lollipops. Forget Beverley Hills. If you want to see the real West Coast, you need to see the streets of Compton and Westmont. Don’t let the juicy, tropical fruit flavours fool you. This is one big, bad motherlover of an APA. Come and join our gang, homes."
