description: "Roll up and follow the Cavalcade to Kiwi overload. Delicate Brett funk unites with fuzzy acidity and tannins of the kiwi. Tropical fruit, fresh tangerine zest and Brett barnyard lead the call. Super dry and surprisingly delicate leaving you spellbound in a magical procession of funk. A blend that alters the parade route for fruited sours forever.   Kiwi Cavalcade - A clarion kiwi call."
