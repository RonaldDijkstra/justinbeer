description: "Our first ever sour beer! We have a soft spot for sours, and we love the rich, tangy flavours of Framboesia. Packed to the brim with the plumpest, juiciest little raspberries we could get our hands on. We've fired them into this kettle soured little vigilante like a drive-by in the fruit aisle. Splat, splat, splat!"
