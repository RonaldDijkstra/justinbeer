description: "The blend of pale ale, Munich, crystal and wheat malts give Goldeneye its full body and rich gold colour. The initial impression of moderate bitterness balances with a clean finish. Fruity citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine shine through with a touch of marmalade sweetness. Named after the beautiful birds that have nested in the Scottish Highlands since 1970, not the 1995 James Bond film!"
