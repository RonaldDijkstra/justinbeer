description: "Our citrusy and refreshing Berliner Weisse is a modern take on a true Berlin classic. Brewed using the same traditional lactic acid cultures as the Berlin brewers of the 1920's, our Berliner Weisse is a bright and sparkling thirst-quencher. The beer embodies the liveliness of summer with the fruity tang of lemon and melon and the tartness of rhubarb and gooseberries. To ensure a properly Stone (and therefore iconoclastic) Berliner Weisse, we upped the ABV to a healthy 4.7% and hopped the beer with new German varieties, Huell Melon and Callista.  Versions exist labelled both White Ghost and White Geist.
