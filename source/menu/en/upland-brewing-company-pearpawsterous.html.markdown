description: "Over the years, we’ve admired many of the beers coming from our friends at Cascade in Portland, Oregon. After visiting and sharing beers together we determined that we had very similar philosophies on sour beer making as well as similar histories with how our programs started. Naturally, we thought it would be awesome to make a beer together. Both programs are very focused on use of whole fruits, and balanced acidity. With similar wheat base beers, we aged our beers on whole paw paws from Indiana and a custom pear blend from Oregon.  Malt bill includes 30% Unmalted Wheat, which undergoes starch conversion by boiling during a “turbid mash”. The beer is then aged for long periods in oak barrels. During fermentation, yeast, Brettanomyces, and other souring microorganisms create a tart, dry and refreshing sour ale. Selected foudre beer was transferred and aged on a blend of Indiana paw paws and Oregon pears.  Pearpawsterous is straw to pale in color with the perfect balance of pawpaw and pear fruit flavors. With a zesty carbonation, it finishes tart and dry."
