description: "Confidence is our hoppy red ale.  It was brewed as a tribute to Kung Fu San Soo Grand Master Jimmy H. Woo whose motto was “You can take my life but not my confidence.”  I was very fortunate to be trained by first generation Master Chuck Cory who instilled that confidence in me.  I designed this red ale in respect of his red master characters.  Without his influence and the positive encouragement of my family I would not have had the confidence (or insanity?!) to chase my dreams around the world.  The beer has a bold ruby colour.  The malt character is quite strong, with generous helpings of toffee, which is overlayed with a bitter and citric hop hit. This beer slides effortlessly past your defenses and assaults your mouth with flavour, leaving you overwhelmed.  The red colour and warming character make it perfect for autumn drinking, so we try to release it around that time annually."
