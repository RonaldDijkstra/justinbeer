description: "Our regular imperial coffee stout is a titan named Umbral Abyss.  Stygian Abyss ages this monster in cognac barrels for many months and this has added a great deal of complexity to the brew.  Much of the intense coffee flavour has been replaces with sweet, sticky flavours of the parent liquor.  Oak is expressed, and a rich and fruity brandied aether encapsulates the experience.  "
