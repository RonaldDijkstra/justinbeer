description: "Tired of talking my friends into pit stops at beer bars before heading “out” — in fear of having to drink bland lager all night — I set out to craft an ale that would act as companion throughout the evening. Leon is assertively hopped and fermented dry using champagne yeast. The yeast and the hops in combination with a simple malt bill provides the beer with a quality of being rich in taste yet refreshing.  Skål!"
