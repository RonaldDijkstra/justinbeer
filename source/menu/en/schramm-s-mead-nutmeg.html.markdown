description: "Schrammâ€™s Nutmeg utilizes the seed of a tropical evergreen, Myristica fragrans, native to the islands of Indonesia. Its aroma is warm, creamy and full-bodied, making it a seasonal favorite for chilly fall evenings. Paired with honey, nutmeg creates a concentrated, voluptuous mead which pairs beautifully with fish and roasted poultry."
