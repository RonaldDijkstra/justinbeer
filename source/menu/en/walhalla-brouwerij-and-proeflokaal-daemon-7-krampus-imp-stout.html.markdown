description: "The seventh Daemon hails from Central Europe, where he is the scary sidekick to Sinterklaas. Naughty children will be carried off in his pouch, whence they are never seen or heard from again. This imperial stout is black as night and heavy in flavor. We added roasted coffee beans and vanilla pods to lure you in with seductive aromas, before the heavy roast and 11,5 % knocks you out."
