description: "This IPA has been dryhopped to the beyond of what we ever did before. You get to follow us to the dark side of the moon. We are totally breaching new ground of flavors. You will encounter rich tropical notes from all the hops that took a plunch into this beer. This is us showing you that we are not holding back, instead pushing the boundaries, promoting freedom, dolphins and craft beer. Just as dolph would do. Its time to free flipper. Cheers to that!"
