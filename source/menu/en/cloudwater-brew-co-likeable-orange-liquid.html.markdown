description: "Our good friends from Other Half joined us for the ninth in a series of collaborations celebrating our first festival, Friends & Family & Beer. Given their pedigree in creating bold, hop-focused beers, we brewed a double dry-hopped DIPA that combines a thick, smooth body with powerful tropical and citrus fruit flavours from a 48g/L dry hop.  Aroma & Flavour: Ripe mango, green papaya and juicy navel orange, followed by orange zest.  Body: Full-bodied, smooth and juicy, with some dryness on the finish.  Aftertaste: Big, tingling resinous hop notes and lingering zesty orange."
