description: "Aurum - Barrel-aged wild blonde ale with flowers and herbs.  Aurum is the liquid gold that originated in our kettle when our friends of Separatist Beer Project visited us last year. Like restless alchemists we fused the elements of their brewery with ours, looking for the highest achievement, the zenith. Separatist brought goldenrod and tulsi (holy) basil from the New World; we took them to a secret field with golden flowers. Inspiration bubbled, creativity flowed, a beer came into existence that no one has ever seen before. Precious in colour, noble in taste, the embodiment of connection. Aurum is a sunny and smooth mildly sour beer that was aged on oak for 10 months.  6.1% ABV  [Batch #1: bottled on 4 APR 2019] "
