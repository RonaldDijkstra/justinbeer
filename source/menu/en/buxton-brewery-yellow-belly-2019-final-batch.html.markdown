description: "The Rainbow Project challenge created by Siren Craft Brew (Wokingham, UK), brings together 14 breweries to make 7 collaborative beers themed on the colours of the rainbow. In 2014, we drew ‘Yellow’ out of the hat and were paired up with the Stockholm based Omnipollo. ... So, with all this in mind, for our ‘Yellow’ beer, we made an 11% Peanut Butter and Biscuit Imperial Stout. Except there are no peanuts or biscuits in it, and it is in no way yellow. We then dressed it in the most hateful, cowardly-anonymous costume we know of. This beer, whilst attempting to make a commentary on the current political winds blowing through Europe, is above all, meant to be enjoyed as a celebration of all things new, open minded and progressive."
