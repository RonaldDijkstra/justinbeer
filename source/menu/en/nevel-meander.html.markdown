description: "Meander - Barrel-aged Golden Sour with Rhubarb and Blackcurrant Leaf.  Meander has a soft, savoury bite of rhubarb that pairs exceptionally well with the red fruity notes of blackcurrant leaf. An exciting, winelike, almost 'pfefferlich' beer that offers notes of green pepper, paprika and elderflower. Drinking Meander is like taking a summer evening stroll in a vegetable garden and being greeted by the many different scents of fruits, vegetables and flowers that grow there. Walking around, all these scents flow into one another like a river that glides through the countryside. Meander is a wonderful treat for the senses and one of the most spectacular drinking experiences we've offered so far!  6.2% ABV  [Batch #1: bottled on 25 JUL 2018] "
