description: "By definition, an India Pale Ale is hoppier and higher in alcohol than its little brother, pale ale â€” and we deliver in spades. Now one of the most well respected and best-selling IPAs in the country, this golden beauty explodes with citrusy flavor and hop aromas, all perfectly balanced by a subtle malt character.  This crisp, extra hoppy brew is hugely refreshing on a hot day, but will always deliver no matter when you choose to drink it.  Hops: Magnum, Chinook & Centennial"
