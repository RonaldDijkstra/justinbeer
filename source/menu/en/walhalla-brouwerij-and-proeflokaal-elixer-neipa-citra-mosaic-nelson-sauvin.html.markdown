description: "This is the third installment in our ongoing hop-forward hazy IPA series, where we keep changing the dry hops with each batch. In this edition we chose to go with a 6,4% beer, dryhopped with Citra, Mosaic and Nelson Sauvin hops. We think it may have magical propertiesâ€¦ Drink fresh!"
