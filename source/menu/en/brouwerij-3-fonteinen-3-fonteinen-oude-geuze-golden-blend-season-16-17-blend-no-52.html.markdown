description: "This specific Golden Blend has a proportion of 25% of 4,5-year old  lambics  on  the  moment  of  bottling. The  lambics  originate from 5 different barrels and 5 different brews, of which one from January 2013 and one from May 2013.  3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze Golden Blend is a blend of one-, two-, three-and at least 25% four-year old lambics. Spontaneous fermentation, patient maturation in oak barrels, and continued evolution in the bottle result in a distinctively complex beer.  No two bottlings are alike, as there are multiple variables in the blending process, a variety of barrel sizes and shapes, differences in aged lambic proportions, etc. When cellared properly, 3 Fonteinen Golden Blend can be aged for several decades. Traditional lambic is living, cultural heritage rooted in the Zenne valley! Bottle fermented, unfiltered and unpasteurised."
