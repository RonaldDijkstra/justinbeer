description: "The light Maredsous Blonde was the abbey's very first beer. Nowadays, the monks still drink it daily at lunch.  Maredsous Blonde is a delectable blonde ale with springy fruitiness, soft malting and a slightly dry, gentle-hopped finish. A sparkling nose, complex flavors and a touch of bitterness give this fine ale all of the refreshing qualities of a classic Belgian blonde."
