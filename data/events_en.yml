    The place to be for beer-lovers in the North of the Netherlands, with an surprising craft-beer and music line-up.
    Hop is one of the most incredible plants mother nature gave to us. This festival is an honour for all the nice beers that are made of it. Quality and originality are the keys for the precisely picked breweries by beer-goeroe Just in Beer.
